Welcome to my website!

I am Tanzeema Aktar Ruhi, currently a Lecturer at East Delta University of Bangladesh. You can know more about my experiences [here](/experience/)

From my [education](/education/), you can see that my background is in Economics, but I am also keen on learning more about data science applications. Merging these two interests, I have always been fascinated about applying different machine learning algorithms and NLP to solve macro and micro level economic problems. As I didn't have any formal background in DS, I self-studied about the basics and worked on two small [projects](/projects/) to express my interest.
