  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <p>
    I am Tanzeema Aktar Ruhi, currently a Lecturer at East Delta University of
    Bangladesh. You can know more about my experiences
    <a href="/experience">here</a>.

  <p>
    From my <a href="/education">education</a>, you can see that my background
    is in Economics, but I am also keen on learning more about data science
    applications. Merging these two interests, I have always been fascinated
    about applying different machine learning algorithms and NLP to solve macro
    and micro level economic problems. As I didn't have any formal background in
    DS, I self-studied about the basics and worked on two small
    <a href="/projects">projects</a> to express my interest.
